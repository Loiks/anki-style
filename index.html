		<p>The souce code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/se110785/anki_style">https://github.com/se110785/anki_style</a>
		<p>Each of these boxes you see here are part of a standardized style sheet I've developed over the past year or so while using Anki. It by no means is an exhaustive set of classes for all situations but it covers the more basic things when learning a language. Namely reviewing: vocabulary, sentences, and conversations. Most of these classes, if not all, can also be used with any type of card, it's really not limited to languages any topic.</p>
		<p>The motivation behind this was that I was looking for a way to flexibly format and re-format my cards. Removing almost all HTML and CSS from Anki ensures that I can change/edit/tweak the color palette or overall theme without having to sift through thousands of cards.</p>

		<div class="box peek">I usually put sentence translations in here so I don't rely on them!</div>
		<div class="box conversation">
		<p>This is a <span class="emphasize">box conversation</span> class! It's designed to hold lots of text. Well, not really, it just makes the text smaller so its manageable. Let's keep adding text to this. Hopefully no one is reading.</p>
		<p>— Note: Text in <span class="emphasize">box conversation</span> looks best when placed within &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; elements</p>
		<p>— Really?</p>
		<p>— Yes! This is how I format a conversation between two people. Most of the conversation text I find or transcribe is run through Google Sheets or Sublime to add &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; elements around line-breaks.</p>
		<p>— Oh! Oh! Oh! Let's not forget tags!</p>
		<p>— Oh yes, most all the cards in my deck have their respective tags displayed this way:</p>

		<div class="box tags"># Hi! I'm a <span class="emphasize">box tag</span>!</div>
